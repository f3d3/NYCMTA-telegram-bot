### Run the bot with systemd
Create a service file, e.g. `/etc/systemd/system/bot.service`
```
[Unit]
Description=Telegram Bot Service
Requires=network.target
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'cd /path-to-folder/NYCMTA-telegram-bot/ && /usr/bin/python3 /path-to-folder/NYCMTA-telegram-bot/bot.py'
Type=simple
User=<user>
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Reload the systemctl daemon. Then, enable the service so that it boots on reboot and start it
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable bot.service
sudo systemctl start bot.service
```

### Run the bot in the background
Use the command below to run the script by getting it to ignore the hangup signal and keep running. Output will be put in `nohup.out`.
```sh 
nohup python3 bot.py &
```
If you do not want an ever-growing `nohup.out` file, you need to redirect the script's output as
```sh 
nohup python3 bot.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
